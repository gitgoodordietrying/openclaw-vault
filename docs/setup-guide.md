# OpenClaw-Vault Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the OpenClaw-Vault from scratch. No terminal experience required — just follow the steps in order.

---

## What You'll Need

- A computer running **Linux**, **macOS**, or **Windows** (with WSL2)
- An **Anthropic API key** (get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- A **Telegram account** (download from [telegram.org](https://telegram.org/) if you don't have one)
- About **30 minutes** for first-time setup

## What You'll Get

A safely contained AI agent on your computer that you control via Telegram. The agent:
- Can answer questions and help with tasks
- Cannot access your files, passwords, or accounts
- Cannot reach unauthorized websites
- Requires your approval for every action
- Can be stopped instantly at any time

---

## Step 1: Install the Container Runtime

The vault runs inside a container — a sealed box on your computer. You need Podman (recommended) or Docker to create this box.

**On Ubuntu/Debian Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman podman-compose
```

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install podman podman-compose
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

**On Windows:**
1. Install [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first
2. Open a WSL terminal, then run the Ubuntu commands above

**Verify it works:**
```bash
podman --version
```
You should see something like `podman version 4.9.3`.

---

## Step 2: Download the Vault

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertdobmeyer/openclaw-vault.git
cd openclaw-vault
```

If you don't have `git` installed:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git    # Linux
brew install git            # macOS
```

---

## Step 3: Create a Dedicated API Key

**Important:** Do NOT use your main API key. Create a dedicated one with a spending limit.

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Navigate to **API Keys**
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Name it something like "vault-test"
5. Go to **Plans & Billing** → **Usage Limits**
6. Set a **hard limit** (e.g., $5) — this caps your spending if anything goes wrong

**Why a separate key?** The vault protects your key (the agent never sees it), but a spending cap is defense-in-depth. If something unexpected happens, the damage is capped at $5.

---

## Step 4: Set Up Your API Key

Run the setup script:
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

It will ask for your API key. Paste it when prompted (the text won't be visible as you type — this is normal, it's a security feature).

**Or do it manually:**
```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here' > .env
chmod 600 .env
```

The `.env` file is never uploaded anywhere — it stays on your computer and is only read by the proxy container.

---

## Step 5: Create Your Telegram Bot

Your AI agent communicates through a Telegram bot. Here's how to create one:

1. Open **Telegram** on your phone or computer
2. Search for **@BotFather** and start a chat
3. Send: `/newbot`
4. Choose a **display name** (e.g., "My OpenClaw Agent")
5. Choose a **username** ending in `_bot` (e.g., `my_openclaw_agent_bot`)
6. BotFather will give you a **token** — it looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`

**Add the token to your vault:**
```bash
echo 'TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-token-here' >> .env
```

Replace `your-token-here` with the actual token from BotFather.

**About your bot:**
- The bot is completely separate from your personal Telegram account
- Nobody can access your personal messages through the bot
- You can delete the bot anytime via @BotFather (`/deletebot`)
- You can create as many bots as you want

---

## Step 6: Build and Start the Vault

```bash
podman build -t openclaw-vault -f Containerfile .
podman tag openclaw-vault openclaw-vault_vault
podman-compose up -d
```

The first build takes 2-5 minutes (it downloads and configures everything). Subsequent starts are much faster.

**Wait about 60 seconds** for everything to initialize, then check that it's running:
```bash
podman ps
```

You should see two containers running:
- `openclaw-vault` — the AI agent (safely contained)
- `vault-proxy` — the security firewall

---

## Step 7: Connect to Your Bot

1. Open **Telegram** on your phone
2. Search for your bot's username (the one you created in Step 5)
3. Send any message (e.g., "Hello")
4. The bot will respond with a **pairing code** — something like `YVBBRLB6`
5. Back in your terminal, run:

```bash
podman exec openclaw-vault openclaw pairing approve telegram YOUR_CODE_HERE
```

Replace `YOUR_CODE_HERE` with the actual code from Telegram.

6. You should see: `Approved telegram sender <your-id>.`

**That's it — your agent is ready!** Send it a message in Telegram and it will respond.

---

## Step 8: Verify Security

Run the security check to confirm everything is locked down:
```bash
bash scripts/verify.sh
```

You should see **15/15 checks passed**. This confirms:
- The agent cannot access your files
- The agent cannot reach unauthorized websites
- Your API key is not visible to the agent
- The agent runs as a restricted user (not admin/root)
- All network traffic goes through the security proxy

---

## Using Your Agent

### What You Can Do
- **Ask questions:** "What's the capital of France?"
- **Get help writing:** "Draft a short email to my boss about being late"
- **Brainstorm:** "Give me 5 ideas for a birthday gift for my mom"
- **Learn:** "Explain how solar panels work in simple terms"

### What the Agent Can't Do (By Design)
- Access your files, photos, or documents
- Read your passwords or accounts
- Send messages as you on other apps
- Install software on your computer
- Access any website not on the approved list
- Run commands on your computer

### Stopping the Agent

**Soft stop** (keeps the session for review):
```bash
bash scripts/kill.sh --soft
```

**Hard stop** (removes everything):
```bash
bash scripts/kill.sh --hard
```

**Starting again after a stop:**
```bash
cd /path/to/openclaw-vault
podman-compose up -d
```

Wait about 60 seconds, then pair Telegram again (see Step 7).

**Starting again after a reboot:**
Same as above. The containers don't auto-start after a reboot — you must run `podman-compose up -d` manually.

### Startup Timing

| What happens | How long |
|-------------|----------|
| Containers created | ~4 seconds |
| Proxy generates security certificate | ~10 seconds |
| OpenClaw reads config and starts | ~30 seconds |
| Gateway ready, Telegram connected | **~60 seconds total** |

You'll know it's ready when the bot responds to your Telegram message.

### Why You Need to Re-Pair After Every Restart

In Gear 1 (Manual mode), the agent has **no persistent memory**. Every restart is a clean slate — including the Telegram pairing. This is a security feature: if the container were ever compromised, restarting it wipes all session data.

This means:
- After every `podman-compose up -d`, send a message to your bot and approve the new pairing code
- The bot won't remember previous conversations after a restart
- Your API key and bot token are preserved (they're in `.env`, not in the container)

### Memory Usage

The vault uses approximately **500 MB of RAM** when running (two containers). On machines with less than 4 GB of total RAM, this may cause slowdowns. Stop the vault when not in use with `bash scripts/kill.sh --soft`.

## Important: The Agent May Claim False Capabilities

The AI agent may sometimes **claim it can do things it actually cannot**. For example, it might say "I ran a command and here are the results" when it actually has no ability to run commands in Gear 1.

**This is a known behavior of smaller AI models.** The agent isn't being malicious — it's trying to be helpful and fills in gaps with plausible-sounding answers. But it can be misleading.

**How to verify:** If the agent claims it did something (ran a command, read a file, accessed a website), you can check the proxy logs:

```bash
podman exec vault-proxy cat /var/log/vault-proxy/requests.jsonl | tail -10
```

If the action doesn't appear in the logs, the agent fabricated it. In Gear 1, the agent can ONLY have conversations — it cannot run commands, read files, or access websites beyond the approved list.

**Rule of thumb:** Trust the proxy logs, not the agent's claims.

## Troubleshooting

### "Container not found" errors
Make sure both containers are running:
```bash
podman ps -a
```
If they exited, check the logs:
```bash
podman logs openclaw-vault
podman logs vault-proxy
```

### Telegram bot doesn't respond
1. Check the vault is running: `podman ps`
2. Check for errors: `podman logs openclaw-vault 2>&1 | grep -i error`
3. Make sure you approved the pairing code (Step 7)

### "Proxy CA cert not found" error
The proxy container might not have started yet. Wait 30 seconds and try:
```bash
podman-compose down
podman-compose up -d
```

### Build fails
Make sure you have enough disk space (`df -h`) and memory (`free -h`). The build needs about 1 GB of disk and 2 GB of RAM.

### Moved the project folder and containers won't start
If you moved the `openclaw-vault` directory to a different location, the existing containers have the old path baked in. Fix:
```bash
podman rm -f vault-proxy openclaw-vault
podman-compose up -d
```
This recreates the containers with the correct paths.

### Agent claims to run commands but nothing happens
This is normal in Gear 1 (Manual mode). The agent's tools are disabled — it cannot run commands, read files, or browse the web. If it claims otherwise, it's fabricating. See the "Important: The Agent May Claim False Capabilities" section above.

## Security Overview

The vault creates three layers of protection:

```
YOUR COMPUTER (safe — the agent can't touch this)
    |
    |  ┌─ Security Proxy (vault-proxy) ──────────────┐
    |  │  ✓ Blocks unauthorized websites              │
    |  │  ✓ Injects your API key (agent never sees it)│
    |  │  ✓ Logs every network request                │
    |  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    |           |
    |  ┌─ Agent Container (openclaw-vault) ───────────┐
    |  │  ✗ Cannot access your files                   │
    |  │  ✗ Cannot run programs on your computer       │
    |  │  ✗ Cannot install software                    │
    |  │  ✗ Cannot see your passwords or accounts      │
    |  │  ✗ Cannot reach unapproved websites           │
    |  │  ✓ Can answer questions via Telegram          │
    |  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Your API key is stored only in the proxy, never in the agent container. Even if the agent were compromised, it cannot see or steal your key.

## Next Steps

- **Explore the settings:** Check `config/openclaw-hardening.json5` to see the security configuration
- **View proxy logs:** `podman exec vault-proxy cat /var/log/vault-proxy/requests.jsonl` shows every request the agent made
- **Learn about gears:** The vault supports multiple security levels (Manual, Semi-Auto, Full-Auto) — coming in future updates
