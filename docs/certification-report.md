## Test Results Summary

Container-level tests (24-point verify, 13 security tests) verified during Phases 6-7. Re-verification deferred to next container session — see Container Verification Checklist below.

## Security Boundary Status

Six defense layers verified across three shell levels:

| Layer | Control | Hard Shell | Split Shell | Soft Shell |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|------------|
| 1. Container Isolation | Read-only root, caps dropped, seccomp, noexec, non-root, PID/mem limits | Active | Active | Active |
| 2. Network Proxy | Domain allowlist, API key injection, request logging, payload limits | 3 domains | 3 domains | 4 domains |
| 3. Tool Policy | Deny list filters tools before LLM sees them | 0 tools | 11 tools | 17 tools |
| 4. Application Restrictions | sandbox.mode off, workspaceOnly, elevated disabled | Active | Active | Active |
| 5. Exec Controls | security mode, ask mode, safeBins whitelist | deny | allowlist + always | allowlist + on-miss |
| 6. Hardening Config | DM pairing, no persistence, telemetry disabled | Active | Active | Active |

**Invariants (all shells):** `sandbox.mode: "off"`, `elevated.enabled: false`, `gateway.mode: "local"`, `channels.telegram.dmPolicy: "pairing"`, `fs.workspaceOnly: true`

**Permanently blocked:** ClawHub domains (11.9% malware rate), interpreters in safeBins, destructive commands (rm, rmdir, chmod, chown)

## Integration Status

### Forge -> Vault (Skill Installation)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Forge certify produces clearance-report.json | PASS |
| Report has required fields (skill, version, scan.status, scan.critical, verify.verdict, checksum) | PASS |
| SHA-256 checksum matches SKILL.md content | PASS |
| Pattern count matches actual scanner (87) | PASS |
| Export packages SKILL.md + clearance-report.json + .trust | PASS |
| Vault install-skill.sh validates clearance reports | Implemented |

### Pioneer -> Vault (Pattern Export)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Pioneer export-patterns produces valid YAML | PASS |
| All 25 patterns have id, severity, regex | PASS |
| All regexes compile with Python re | PASS |
| Integrity hash present and valid (SHA-256) | PASS |
| Pattern count matches source config (25) | PASS |
| Severity values valid (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) | PASS |

### Orchestrator Discovery

All three modules discovered via manifest-driven architecture:
- `openclaw-vault` — role: runtime
- `clawhub-forge` — role: toolchain
- `moltbook-pioneer` — role: network

---

## Module Completion Status

| Module | Phases | Status | Key Artifacts |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| openclaw-vault | 1-8 | Complete | 3 shell configs, 24-point verify, 13 security tests, tool manifest |
| clawhub-forge | 1-4 | Complete (Phase 5 deferred) | 87-pattern scanner, CDR pipeline, AI creation wizard, 25 certified skills |
| moltbook-pioneer | 1-5 | Complete | 25 injection patterns, pattern export with ReDoS hardening, 3 tools |

---

## Known Issues & Deferred Items

| Item | Reason | When |
|------|--------|------|
| VM isolation stubs (Hyper-V/WSL) | Aspirational — container isolation is complete | Phase 9+ |
| Feed scanning in vault-proxy | Moltbook domains not in allowlist | When Moltbook access enabled |
| Forge Phase 5 (CI/CD) | ClawHub API not verified live | When API becomes accessible |
| README screenshot placeholder | Needs container running for verify.sh output | Next container session |

None of these block operational use. All are explicitly documented with clear reasoning.

## Container Verification Checklist

Items to verify next time vault containers are started:

- [ ] Run `make verify` on Hard Shell — expect 24/24 PASS
- [ ] Run `make verify` on Split Shell — expect 24/24 PASS
- [ ] Run `make verify` on Soft Shell — expect 24/24 PASS
- [ ] Run `make test` — expect 13/13 PASS (security tests)
- [ ] Verify round-trip shell switching: Hard -> Split -> Soft -> Split -> Hard
- [ ] Capture verify.sh terminal output for README screenshot
- [ ] Verify skill installation workflow: forge export -> vault install-skill.sh

## Certification Statement

All host-side validation gates pass. The OpenClaw ecosystem (vault + forge + pioneer) is operationally complete:

- **67 host-side checks passing** (39 orchestrator + 28 integration)
- **All cross-module data contracts validated** (clearance reports, pattern exports, cross-references)
- **All three component manifests** parse, validate, and align with schema
- **All submodules** synced, on branches, working trees clean
- **Documentation** reviewed and corrected for accuracy
- **Deferred items** explicitly documented with clear reasoning

Container-level verification (24-point security checks, 13 attack surface tests) was last verified during Phase 7 implementation and should be re-run at next container session per the checklist above.
