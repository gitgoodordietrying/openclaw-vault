OpenClaw = the local agent framework (the software you run).

Moltbook = the agent-only social network (a platform/service).

ClawHub = the skills/plugin registry for OpenClaw.
Also: Clawdbot / Moltbot = earlier names of OpenClaw.

Now the clean mental model.

1) The stack (what each thing actually is)
OpenClaw → the runtime / agent

Open-source autonomous AI assistant that runs on your machine or server.

Has tools, memory, integrations, can execute actions.

Extensible via “skills.”

Formerly called Clawdbot → briefly Moltbot → now OpenClaw.

So this is the compute + control layer.

Moltbook → the social network for agents

A network where AI agents post, follow, comment, and exchange signals.

You don’t run Moltbook locally; you connect an agent to it via API/auth.

Conceptually: “Twitter/Reddit for bots.”

It is not the agent itself.

So this is the coordination / social layer.

ClawHub → the skills marketplace

Registry of downloadable “skills” (plugins/capabilities) for OpenClaw agents.

Comparable to a package index for agent actions.

Agents pull capabilities from here.

So this is the capability distribution layer.

2) How they fit together (system view)

Think in layers:

[ ClawHub ]        → capability supply (skills)
       ↓
[ OpenClaw ]       → the actual autonomous agent runtime
       ↓
[ Moltbook ]       → multi-agent social/coordination environment

An operator typically:

runs OpenClaw locally

installs skills from ClawHub

connects the agent to Moltbook to interact with other agents

3) Why the naming is so confusing

Because the agent was rapidly rebranded:

Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw (within days)

At the same time:

Moltbook launched

Tutorials, blogs, and hype posts mixed all names together

So older content uses the old names as if they’re different systems.

4) Important reality check

A lot of the ecosystem is:

very new

heavily community-driven

partly marketing / narrative-amplified

And multiple analyses highlight:

weak security

prompt-injection propagation through the social layer

malicious skills in the registry


So from an architecture perspective this is an experimental agent-internet pattern, not a mature production stack.

5) Big-picture abstraction (what this really is)

This is an attempt at an “Internet of agents” reference architecture:

Agent runtime → OpenClaw

Capability marketplace → ClawHub

Agent social graph / signaling layer → Moltbook

In other words:
a distributed multi-agent ecosystem with a shared coordination surface.

6) One-line mapping

Same thing? → No.

Same ecosystem? → Yes.

Different layers of the same pattern? → Exactly.

Position everything by what layer of the agent stack it occupies and what problem it is trying to solve.

Use OpenClaw as the reference baseline: a stateful, tool-using, autonomous local agent with a plugin registry and optional agent-to-agent social network.
